### I used Expo Cause it's my first Mobile App

Expo is a set of tools built around React Native, making it easier to get started with developing React Native applications. It provides a managed environment, meaning you don't have to worry about setting up Xcode or Android Studio, and you can write JavaScript code immediately. Expo also includes a number of APIs out of the box for accessing device capabilities, which can save you time. Furthermore, Expo's "Over the Air" updates feature allows you to publish updates to your app without needing to go through the app store review process again. However, it's worth noting that while Expo is great for getting started quickly and for simpler applications, it can be less flexible than using React Native CLI for more complex applications that require custom native code.
